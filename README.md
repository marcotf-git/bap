# Baking App

This project is an exercise as part of the **Android Developer Nanodegree**, by **Udacity**. The app allows a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipes are in a JSON file, that contains the recipe's instructions, ingredients, videos and images. This file was in the `assets` folder of the project directory.

The application has a companion widget, that displays an ingredient list for the desired recipe. It also can open the app if we click on the widget title. üç™

** _This app is for learning purposes._ ** üìö
